# KNN Classification with PCA on MNIST Dataset

This project implements KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) classification from scratch in Python on the MNIST dataset using PCA (Principal Component Analysis). MNIST is a well-known dataset in machine learning that consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each with 784 features (28x28 pixels).
## Features

This project includes the following features:

    Implementation of KNN algorithm from scratch
    PCA for dimensionality reduction on MNIST dataset
    Classification of MNIST images using KNN algorithm
    Evaluation of classification performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset used in this project is publicly available on the MNIST homepage. The dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits (0-9), each with 784 features (28x28 pixels). The dataset is split into a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images.
## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

    NumPy
    Matplotlib
    Scikit-learn
