# Glass Classification

This project is a classification problem using machine learning to classify different types of glass based on their chemical composition. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of machine learning algorithms for classification problems. Deployed in Streamlit.
## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It consists of 214 samples of glass with different attributes, such as refractive index, sodium, magnesium, aluminum, and other chemical properties.
## Features

This application uses several machine learning algorithms for classification of different types of glass:

    Logistic Regression
    Random Forest Classifier
    Decision Tree Classifier
    K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3.x and the following libraries:

    NumPy
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn

## Usage

To run the classification algorithms, simply execute the Glass_Classification.ipynb Jupyter notebook. This notebook contains all the code and visualizations used in the analysis.
